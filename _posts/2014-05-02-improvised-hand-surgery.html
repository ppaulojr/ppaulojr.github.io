<p>This one was an amazing surgery and I'm glad the recovery was complete. I miss Amajari sometimes.</p>
<blockquote><p>A case of a man of 55 years old with a severe hand injury caused by a chainsaw cut during his fence building work. This man was treated in an improvised surgical table in a humanitarian mission in a very isolated area of Amazon rain forest. Prompt asepsis and reconstruction of main anatomic structures proved successful. Also correct management of blood pressure and saline reposition saved him from further medical emergency.</p></blockquote>
