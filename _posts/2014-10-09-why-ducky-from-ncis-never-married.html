<p>The answer comes from Episode 3 in Season 12</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPTURb_0wY</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="Apple-dash-list">
<li>Why didn't you ever marry? You had so much love to give.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A colleague and a very good friend of mine lost his soul mate. And then he nearly wrecked his life marrying the wrong woman over and over, trying to find her again. Â I...chose to skip that part.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't believe in the concept of "soul mate", nevertheless it's an interesting scene to think about.</p>
