<p>While developing a business app we decided to introduce quotes during the login process to alleviate the wait for the user and cheer them up.</p>
<p>Our creative methodology was to brainstorm quotes and select some for the final database inside the app. But then there's the concern of the risk of controversial quotes that may angry the user or upset some folks and there's the thin red, and very blurred, line of what's controversial or not.</p>
<p>I'm sure we all agree that quoting the Samuel L. Jackson speech on Snakes on a Plane is not kosher for a business app. I'd love to quote it but I concede that .... well you can see below</p>

<p>But then we have quotes that some folks though as controversial that I would never dream of labeling in that category. </p>
<p><strong>Here some examples:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>"<i>Well, he should have some chocolate, at the very least.</i>" -- Harry Potter book 3</p></blockquote>
<p>Tagged as controversial because it might evoke witchcraft which may upset folks of some religion.</p>
<blockquote><p><span>I don't ask why patients lie, I just assume they all do. -- House MD</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Too cynical and biased.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.  -- <span>Corinthians 13:4</span></span></p></blockquote>
<p>May upset atheist. It's the Bible ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span>"You can't handle the truth!" - A few good men</span>
</p></blockquote>

Some folks can't handle the quotes :) So scrap that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span>"My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions and loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius, father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next." - Gladiator</span></p>
</blockquote>

Too violent</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span>"I didn't come to rescue Rambo from you. I came here to rescue you from him." -- Lt. Col. Trautman, First Blood (1982)</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The same reason</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span>"I know what you're thinking: "Did he fire six shots or only five?" Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk?" - Dirty Harry</span></p>
</blockquote>

That's my favorite, but unfortunately it didn't make the cut of non-controversial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span>"I never forget a face, but in your case I’d be glad to make an exception." -- </span>Groucho Marx</p></blockquote>
<p>Too ironic :)</p>
<blockquote><p><span>"My psychiatrist told me I was crazy and I said I want a second opinion. He said okay, you’re ugly too" -- Internet wisdom</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Same reason ...</p>
<p>But I was thinking that if we broaden the scope of what's controversial we could impeach almost all quotes.<br />
<strong>Let's watch the destruction process:<br />
</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><span>"Be the change that you wish to see in the world." -- Gandhi</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Well Mr. Gandhi, you are a very cool guy and almost everyone loves you, but your quote may upset great part of the traditional Hindi population</p>
<blockquote><p><span>"The time is always right to do what is right" - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Another wonderful person that upset a great deal of folks, specially in the southern parts of the United States.</p>
<p>If we broaden our scope for what's controversial, life becomes boring and although I concede that</p>
<blockquote><p>"Enough is ENOUGH! I have had it with these motherfuckin' snakes on this motherfuckin' plane! Everybody strap in! <i>(extracts his gun)</i> I'm about to open some fuckin' windows."</p></blockquote>
<p>Is not appropriate for a business app, I think we can allow more color to our user's lives by reducing what we consider controversial.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear other opinions on the subject.</p>
