<p>Most of the comments I made in this bookclub before were related with the translation but this one is about Cardinal Bergoglio and shedding light on how to parse better the discourses and interviews of the Holy Father.</p>
<p>In the day of the election the change of name from Jorge Mario to Francisco means in a symbolic way that Jorge Mario died and now there's another successor of St. Peter named Francisco. The same goes to all Popes. A better version of this would be Jorge Mario is now Francisco.</p>
<p>The Pope is assisted by the Holy Spirit in his task of being the vicar of Christ, but it's a mistake to forget that each Pope brings his culture, his formation and his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_language" rel="nofollow">L1</a>.</p>
<p><b>St. John Paul II</b></p>
<p>During many centuries the bishops of Rome were Italians, that changed in 1978 and St. John Paul II governed the church with his personal attributes, the Polish heritage, the cultural background and his ability to quickly learn languages. But for St. John Paul II I'll focus on the cultural background. During his young years he loved theatre and that was a tool he took into his papacy. I would suggest that you take a break now and watch the video below:</p>

<p>John Paul II wanted to send a powerful message in Nicaragua, he knew that moment would be broadcasted, without government interference, for the World to see. He sent the intended message, and he used a body language that spoke volumes to the average Spanish-speaking national in Central and South America. George Weigel's book gives you the full picture of the event and why that gesture was not a spur of the moment decision. I believe the young Karol in his years of theatre influenced the gestures of the Pope that day.</p>
<p><b>Benedict XVI</b></p>
<p>Then we have Benedict XVI and now we can focus on his formation. Cardinal Ratzinger is, in my opinion, the greatest theological scholar of the XX century. I think his theological formation empowered him with tools to write advanced theology in a way understandable by the average Catholic. Card. Ratzinger when elected had more than 23 years living in Rome, speaking and writing in Italian in a daily basis and, although a few times he was misinterpreted, he knew from day 1 to communicate very well to the people of Rome.</p>
<p><b>Francis</b></p>
<p>And then we arrive at Pope Francis and I'll focus on L1. We could talk about Pope Francis not being Italian, not being European and having a Jesuit background. But I'll direct the last part of this comment to the fact Card. Bergoglio main language is Spanish and not the Spanish spoken in Spain but in South America and this is a huge factor to understand the way he communicates. For exemple, in Latin American concepts like Left-Right/Liberal-Conservative <a href="http://nobodyreadit.wordpress.com/2014/10/26/brazil-vs-usa-comparing-concepts-rightleft-vs-liberalconservative/" rel="nofollow">have a very distinct meaning</a> from the corresponding translations to English.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jmjrio2013" rel="nofollow">WYD2013</a>, in a very peripheral part of the organization, I was "babysitting" a Cardinal from Latin America. In those days I drove him in my car and we chatted a lot. He told me that when studying for priesthood in Europe he was quite influenced by the Spaniard way of speaking, after the return to his country most people thought he was being rude because the way a Spaniard speaks is very harsh compared to a South American and a corollary of this conversation was that Pope Francis would take this soft touch of South American Spanish into Italian. The Argentinian culture is embedded in the L1 of Pope Francis.</p>
<p><b>The challenges of a South American Pope</b></p>
<p>What I'm about to say is not depreciative but a theory I have. The average American, and now I'm referring to the US citizen, is not equipped with a good knowledge of other cultures, specially re South America and Africa. I have a great affection and admiration for the US, their culture and people, but even very well educated people I met in US make serious mistakes about facts and events of South America. I know it's not the case of most of the readers of this blog, but the average US catholic has little or no knowledge on how an Argentinian thinks.</p>
<p>Wrapping up this long comment I'd suggest that if you want to better understand who is Cardinal Bergoglio that turned into Pope Francis a well invested time (as weird as it may sound coming from a Brazilian guy) is to read about the culture of Argentina. Some resources bellow and now I will shut up!</p>
