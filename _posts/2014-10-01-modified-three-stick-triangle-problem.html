excerpt: Suppose you break a stick in a random point of its length, from the two pieces
  you have now, choose the largest piece and break again randomly. What is the likelihood
  of you form a triangle with the three pieces?
---
<p>Studying at PUC-Rio there was a course called Probabilistic Models given by the Telecommunication Engineering Department, which was well-known for their creative approach to student evaluation. In one of those exams there was a question described below:</p>
<blockquote><p>Suppose you break a stick in a random point of its length, from the two pieces you have now, choose the largest piece and break again randomly. What is the likelihood of you form a triangle with the three pieces?</p></blockquote>
<p>Before you go nuts looking in Google, note that this problem is slightly different from the <em>"three stick triangle problem"</em> , in ours the second time you choose to break the biggest piece which is different of breaking a stick into 3 pieces directly. <strong>Warning</strong>: if you want to try to solve it, stop reading now. There are two ways to solve this problem, a computational way, that was not the case at the time, and an analytical form. The analytic form is interesting but requires further mathematical knowledge. But a computational form is available for anyone who knows how to program as in the Python script below.</p>

<p>Now let's see how to solve it analytically. &lt;continue&gt; Considering the ruler as having length 1, we divide the problem into two parts that are symmetrical. In the first part the break occurred at the point n ( <strong>0 &lt;n &lt;0.5</strong> ) until 50% of the length of the ruler. Thus the second break may not occur, to respect the triangular inequality:</p>
<p>$latex A&gt;B+C$</p>
<p>where <strong>A</strong> is the length of the longest piece in the sections:</p>
<p>$latex [N,\frac{1}{2}];[1-(\frac{1}{2}-n);1]$</p>
<p>As you can see in the figure below:</p>
<p><a href="https://nobodyreadit.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/tri-300x129.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-105 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tri-300x129.png" alt="Tri-300x129" width="300" height="129" /></a></p>
<p>Thus, once the break point in the ruler n&gt;0.5  the probability of forming a triangle is given by:</p>
<p><a href="https://nobodyreadit.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/breakr-300x138.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-103 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/breakr-300x138.png" alt="breakR-300x138" width="300" height="138" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://nobodyreadit.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/latex-php-4.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-110" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/latex-php-4.png" alt="latex.php-4" width="84" height="21" /></a></p>
<p>Therefore, the probability of forming a triangle is:</p>
<p><a href="https://nobodyreadit.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/latex-php.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/latex-php.png" alt="latex.php" width="149" height="45" /></a></p>
<p>Solving the integral we get:</p>
<p><a href="https://nobodyreadit.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/latex-php-2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-108" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/latex-php-2.png" alt="latex.php-2" width="144" height="20" /></a></p>
<p>As we were two symmetrical that the probability of forming a triangle problems is:</p>
<p><a href="https://nobodyreadit.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/latex-php-3.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-109" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/latex-php-3.png" alt="latex.php-3" width="165" height="20" /></a></p>
<p>That's the same value obtained by our simulation.</p>
