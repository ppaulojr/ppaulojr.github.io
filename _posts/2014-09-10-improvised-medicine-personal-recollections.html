<p>Organizing volunteer work camps in Amajari, RR in multiple years was for me a unique and unforgettable experience from which I took many lessons.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of medicine, the main learning was the need to be prepared and know how to improvise.</p>
<p>Some friends have suggested that I write a book of these experiences about improvisation, I doubt if anyone would read it, but either way, I'll be logging here to remember the most interesting topics:</p>
<p>- Containing an AIDS epidemic with improvised tests<br />
- Endotracheal intubation without a laryngoscope<br />
- Learn to diagnose malaria in the microscope with an illiterate technician.</p>
<p>The most astounding improvisation <a title="Improvised hand surgery" href="http://nobodyreadit.wordpress.com/2014/05/02/improvised-hand-surgery/">we published in a paper</a>.</p>
<p>Some friends did a documentary about our adventures there. It went to a film festival and the teaser you'll find below:</p>
